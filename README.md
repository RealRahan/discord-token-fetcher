## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Overview

### Authentication Flow

1.  The script sends an initial login request to Discord's `/auth/login` endpoint.
2.  The server response indicates if 2FA is required (HTTP status code 400 with the `mfa` flag).
3.  For 2FA-enabled accounts, the script exchanges a temporary ticket for TOTP verification.
4.  Finally, upon successful authentication, the access token is retrieved.

## üîí Security Notes

  - **Token Display:** The fetched token is displayed only once and is not stored by the script.
  - **Clipboard Avoidance:** The script does not automatically copy the token to the clipboard to minimize potential exposure.
  - **HTTPS Only:** All network communication is conducted over secure HTTPS.
  - **No Proxies:** The script connects directly to Discord's servers without using intermediate proxies.
  - **Isolated Environment:** It is recommended to run this script in an isolated environment for testing purposes.
  - **Token Revocation:** After you have finished using the script for its intended purpose, consider revoking the generated token through your Discord settings.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

| Error                     | Solution                                          |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Captcha required          | Wait 1-2 hours before attempting to log in again. |
| Invalid email/password    | Double-check your login credentials.              |
| Invalid 2FA code          | Ensure the code from your authenticator app is current and entered correctly. |
| Rate limited              | Reduce the frequency of your requests.           |
| `requests` module not found | Run `pip install requests` in your terminal.     |
